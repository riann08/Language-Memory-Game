# Language-Memory-Game
1st Project (Ironhack Bootcamp) 
PAR WD FT Cohort 911 

It is an educational game intended to learn some Spanish greetings and expressions.
The goal was to make learning languages more fun and based on the notion that repetition is key to remembering stuff (wax on wax off, right?).

The goal is to find the corresponding English-Spanish equivalents with the fewest moves and with the least time possible.

There are a still lot of things to improve so IÂ´m open for comments and suggestions. :) 

I hope you enjoy it.
